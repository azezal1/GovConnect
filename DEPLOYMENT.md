## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Option 1: Traditional Hosting

**Backend (Node.js hosting):**
1. Deploy to Heroku, Railway, or DigitalOcean
2. Set environment variables
3. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
4. Configure Cloudinary for image uploads

**Frontend (Static hosting):**
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3
3. Update API URLs in production

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

**Create Dockerfile for backend:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**Create Dockerfile for frontend:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=0 /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

### Option 3: Cloud Deployment

**AWS/Azure/GCP:**
